	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem 1: shuffle a standard deck of cards}
	\section*{Problem 1}We shuffle a standard deck of cards, obtaining a permutation that is uniform over all 52! possible permutations.
	\subsection{Define a proper probability space $\Omega$ for the above random process}
	 	$\Omega$  is all the permutations of the 52 cards, that are 52! \newline
		 This corresponds to all the possible ways a deck can be shuffled.

	\subsection{Find the probability of the following events}

	% 1.2.a
	\begin{adjustwidth}
	\subsubsection{The first three cards include at least one ace}
	Let define the event $\mathit{E}$ = "The first three cards doesn't include any ace" \newline
	P($\mathit{E}$) = "the first card isn't an ace" $\times$ "the second card isn't an ace" $\times$ "the third card isn't an ace" \newline
	P($\bar{E}$) = 1 - P($\mathit{E}$) = 1 - $\cfrac{48}{52}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{47}{51}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{46}{50}$ = 0,217375566 (that is the probability that at least one ace appear in the first three cards)

	\end{adjustwidth}

	% 1.2.b
	\begin{adjustwidth}
	\subsubsection{The first five cards include exactly one ace}
	Exactly one ace in five cards can be seen as the sum of five events: $E_1$ $E_2$ $E_3$ $E_4$ $E_5$, where $E_i$ corresponds to "the ace is in position $i$"
	\newline Each $E_i$ has the probability $P(E_i)$ = $\cfrac{4}{52}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{48}{51}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{47}{50}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{46}{49}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{44}{48}$ = 0,059894727
	\newline This formula doesn't depend on the position of the ace, in fact the latter one corresponds to $P(E_1)$ and if we invert on the numerator the factor 4 with the factor 48 then the probability corresponds to $P(E_2)$.
	\newline $P(E)$ = $P(E_1)$ + $P(E_2)$ + $P(E_3)$ + $P(E_4)$ + $P(E_5)$ = 5 $\times$ $P(E_i)$ = 5 $\times$ 0,059894727 = 0,299473635
	\end{adjustwidth}

	% 1.2.c
	\begin{adjustwidth}
	\subsubsection{The first three cards are all of the same rank (they are the same number or both are J, or all three are Q, etc.)}
	Whatever the first card is, the probability to have three cards of the same rank depends only by the second card and the third card.
	\newline $P(E)$ = "the $2^{nd}$ card is of the same rank of the $1^{st}$ one" $\times$ "the $3^{rd}$ card is of the same rank as the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ ones"
	\newline $P(E)$ = $\cfrac{3}{51}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{2}{50}$ = 0,002352941
	\end{adjustwidth}

	% 1.2.d
	\begin{adjustwidth}
	\subsubsection{The first five cards are all diamonds.}
	Everytime we pick a diamond card, the next step the number of diamond cards we can pick are decreased by one.
	\newline Number of diamond cards = 13
	\newline  $P(E)$ = $\cfrac{13}{52}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{12}{51}$ $\times$$\cfrac{11}{50}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{10}{49}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{9}{48}$ = 0,000495198
	\end{adjustwidth}

	% 1.2.e
	\begin{adjustwidth}
	\subsubsection{The first five cards form a full house (three of one rank and two of another rank).}
	A full house is composed by a pair plus a tris, that have different rank. \newline
	\\
	For example: $E$ = XXYYY is a full house, where:
	\begin{easylist}[itemize]
		& X can be whatever rank of a card;
		& Y must be a rank not equal to X.
	\end{easylist}
	\\		% empty line
	The full house event in the example is composed by these five events:
	\begin{easylist}[itemize]
	& "pick the first card (can be anyone)"
	& "pick the second card with the same rank of the first one in order to have a pair"
	& "pick the third card wiht rank different from the first two cards"
	& "pick the fouth card with the same rank as the third one, in order to have 2/3 of a tris"
	& "pick the fifth and last card in order to comple the tris"
	\end{easylist}
	\\
	$P(E)$ = $\cfrac{3}{51}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{48}{50}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{3}{49}$ $\times$ $\cfrac{2}{48}$ $\times$ = 0,000144058
	\\
	\\
	This is the probability to have exactly this kind of full house (XXYYY). But we can also have:
	\begin{easylist}[itemize]
		& XYXYY
		& XYYXY
		& ...
	\end{easylist}
	\\
	If we count all these possible permutation, we'll end up with $\frac{5!}{3!2!}$ = 10 where 5 is the number of cards to permute, 3 and 2 are the rank of the cards that repeat in the permutation.
	\\\\
	The final probability to have a full house is: 10 $\times$ $P(E)$ = 0,00144058
